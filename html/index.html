Semantic tags in HTML allow for easier navigation by people with disabilities. It also encourages a more standardized way of coding for developers.
I feel that nav and footer/header are super useful because it could be very confusing just hearing a computer read those off without context.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
