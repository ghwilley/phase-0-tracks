<h3>Beer Types</h3>
<p>This is a <em>pretty</em> crappy table of different types of beer.
It's crappy because there are so many outliers and other ways to describe beer. There are light stouts, there are roasty IPA's. There's a massive world of funky and sour beers that doesn't really fall under any of these descriptors. I'm not changing it though, so deal with it.</p>
