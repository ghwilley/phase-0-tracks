# HOW DO I jQUERY

-make a jQuery file.
-maybe mess around in coderpad if that's got a jQ mode
-find a cheatsheet
-look up when to use jQ
-use an old site to mess around with some of that cheat sheet code
-check out a prexisting jQ file
-finally build out a final whatever thing



# DOING THE THING - NOTES
ok. so that's how that works.

dont need to download because google and MICROsoft already have it hosted for us.
``` <head>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
</head> ```

GET THE DOC READY

``` $(document).ready(function(){

   // jQuery methods go here...

}); ```

functions seem to work in a similar way to css. The file called is hosted through google though so you dont need to include another file on your server to ref. W3 schools intro to jQuery is really helpful.
The cheat sheet here https://oscarotero.com/jquery/ is rather helpful too.
