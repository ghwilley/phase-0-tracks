# 2. GET vs POST
Get requests are for getting data from a source, Post requests submit data to a source.
Get requests seem to be the most common, for accessing data etc. Post requests
seem to be when you're sending data, such as uploading a picture or filling out a form.
When you hit back after submitting a form the brower alerts you that the data will be resubmitted, and you can't bookmark that data etc.. it simply gets sent off to the server.
