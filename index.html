<h3>What is beer made out of?</h3>
<p>Beer is made out of water, malted barley, hops and yeast. You're probably wondering what all those ingredients are, and luckily I'm going to tell you. <strong>Water</strong> is like fruit juice without the fruit parts. <strong>Malted barley</strong> is barley that's been soaked in warm water so it starts germinating and converting starches into sugars so that you can get a higher and more efficient yield of alcohol and desired proteins from the grains. <strong>Hops</strong> are these little cones that grow on bines (NOT VINES, I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE), they taste bitter and preserve beer. They're also deadly to dogs. Seriously, keep hops away from your dog. <strong>Yeast</strong> is a microorganism that's pretty much everywhere. Yeast eats the sugars from the barley and makes alcohol and CO2 so you get a fizzy beverage that makes you happy. </p>
