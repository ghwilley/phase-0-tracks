# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version Control is a method that tracks changes to a file or software. This allows you to fall back to or check an earlier version, should you want to revert changes or if you run into a bug.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of an original file or group of files. This allows you to edit features or add features without effecting the main file. You can then implement them once you've got the feature working 100%.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is like saving a new file with changes. The message should include whatever changes have been made so that you can easily look back and see when changes were made, should any errors show up.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is an error that forms when you merge a branch and not all of the data lines up. Either data is missing, or the same lines of data have been modified.
